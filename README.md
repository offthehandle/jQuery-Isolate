jQuery Isolate
==============

Isolate is a dynamic plugin with options to perform faceted filtering or isolation of elements with the click of a button. Highly configurable, Isolate supports Bootstrap scaffolding with ease. Built-in CSS scaffolding support with LESS source is also provided for non-Bootstraped projects, but not required.
